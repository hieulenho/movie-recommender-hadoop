# Scalable Movie Recommender System Using Item-Based Collaborative Filtering and Hadoop MapReduce

This repository contains the planned structure and documentation for an academic Big Data project that will build a scalable offline movie recommender system. The final system is intended to use Item-Based Collaborative Filtering with Apache Hadoop MapReduce to generate Top-K movie recommendations from historical rating data.

Current status: **Milestone 0 - Project Initialization and Architecture Documentation**.

No preprocessing pipeline, recommendation algorithm, Hadoop job, web UI, or evaluation code has been implemented yet.

## Main Objectives

- Define a clean repository structure for a Hadoop-based recommender project.
- Document the planned architecture, data formats, and milestone roadmap.
- Prepare the project for later implementation of preprocessing, MapReduce jobs, evaluation, and optional demo components.
- Keep implementation decisions traceable through version-controlled documentation.

## Planned Technologies

- Java
- Apache Hadoop MapReduce
- HDFS
- Maven
- Python for preprocessing, validation, and evaluation
- Docker as a possible local Hadoop environment

## Planned Pipeline

```text
raw data
-> preprocessing
-> user histories
-> item-pair statistics
-> item similarity
-> prediction
-> filtering watched movies
-> Top-K recommendations
-> evaluation
```

## Data Policy

Large datasets, processed data, generated outputs, build artifacts, secrets, and local environment files must not be committed to Git. Small sample fixtures may be added later under `data/sample` or `tests/fixtures` when needed for tests and documentation.

## Setup and Run Instructions

Setup, build, data preparation, Hadoop execution, and evaluation instructions will be added in later milestones.
